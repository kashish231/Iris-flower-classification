# Iris-flower-classification
Task-2 Iris-flower-classification BHARAT INTERN

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying Iris flowers using the famous Iris dataset. The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook and utilizes the 'IRIS.csv' dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

Project Overview The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on certain features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification and pattern recognition tasks.
